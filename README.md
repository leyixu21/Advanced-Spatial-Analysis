# Advanced-Spatial-Analysis
The course Advanced Spatial Analysis includes three data challenges which involve spatial data analysis, clustering and classification, network analysis, and time series analysis in R.

## Data Challenge 1
Data Challenge 1 uses the NYC Citibikes dataset to showcase geographical data analysis.

Please refer to [DC1_Investigation of NYC Citibikes dataset Markdown](https://github.com/leyixu21/Advanced-Spatial-Analysis/blob/main/DC1_Investigation%20of%20NYC%20Citibikes%20dataset.Rmd) for detailed information.

### Examples
- Plot a histogram of all trips shorter than 45 minutes.

- Generate a sub-sample containing a random 10% of the data, and for that subsample plot the time to ride the (beeline) distance.

## Data Challenge 2
Data Challenge 2 uses clustering and classification to label the land use.

Please refer to [DC2_Clustering & Classification Markdown](https://github.com/leyixu21/Advanced-Spatial-Analysis/blob/main/DC2_Clustering%20%26%20Classification.Rmd) and [DC2_Report](https://github.com/leyixu21/Advanced-Spatial-Analysis/blob/main/DC2_Report.pdf) for detailed information.

### Clustering
- K-means
- Dimension reduction
- Comparison of K-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering

### Classification
- k nearest neighbor (kNN)
- Decision tree (DT)
- Random forest (RF)
- Artificial neural networks (ANN)
- Comparison of models generated by four algorithms

## Data Challenge 3
Data Challenge 3 compares the network of Zurich and New York with network analysis and explores pedestrian flows in Zurich before and during COVID-19 with time series analysis.

Please refer to [DC3_Network Analysis & Time Series Analysis Markdown](https://github.com/leyixu21/Advanced-Spatial-Analysis/blob/main/DC3_Network%20Analysis%20%26%20Time%20Series%20Analysis.Rmd) and [DC3_Report](https://github.com/leyixu21/Advanced-Spatial-Analysis/blob/main/DC3_Report.pdf) for detailed information.

### Network analysis of Zurich and New York streets
- Creation of street graphs and dual graphs
- Calculation of graph centralities
- Visualization and numerical analysis of graphs

### Time series analysis of pedestrian flows in Zurich
- Decomposition analysis
- Autoregressive modeling
- Break points detection during COVID-19
